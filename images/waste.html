        I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in
        large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported
        by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation
        Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and
        grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the
        National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and
        Sciences.

        <li>In 2021 and 2022, Karen Levy and I taught a new course entitled Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO
            1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a
            range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>

            <li><em>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks. The book, like
                    the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
                    support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced
                    sections.</em></li>

                This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach. We also use the more
